# ShapeSegmentation

Try to do segmentation over ShapeNetPart and PartNet dataset.

1. After training, we find that we seem to have the problem of overfitting. 
    i think we may should have some data augmentation, and we can see the result.
    Overfitting is not eased after augmentation.

2. Setup few-shot learning scehme. 

3. Follow point transformer. Setup a ShapeNetPart segmentation pipeline.
